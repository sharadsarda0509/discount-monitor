## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Fork or Create Repository

1. Create a new **private** repository on GitHub (recommended for privacy)
2. Clone this folder's contents to your new repository

### Step 2: Configure Gmail App Password

Since you'll be using Gmail to send alerts, you need to create an App Password:

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to **Security**
3. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
4. Go to **App passwords**: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
5. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)** → Enter "Flipkart Monitor"
6. Click **Generate**
7. Copy the 16-character password (you'll use this in Step 3)

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository on GitHub:
1. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret** and add these three secrets:

| Secret Name | Value | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `SENDER_EMAIL` | your-email@gmail.com | Your Gmail address |
| `RECEIVER_EMAIL` | your-email@gmail.com | Email where you want to receive alerts (can be same) |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | *app-password* | The 16-character app password from Step 2 |

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. If prompted, click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**
3. The workflow will now run automatically every 30 minutes

### Step 5: Test the Setup (Optional)

To test without waiting 30 minutes:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **"Flipkart Discount Monitor"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"** button
4. Wait a few seconds and check the run results

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logs

### BigBasket stock alerts

`check_bigbasket_iphone.py` monitors base iPhone 15/16/17 handsets at
`BIGBASKET_LAT` / `BIGBASKET_LON` (default pincode `560035`, configurable with
`BIGBASKET_PINCODE`). Requests explicitly select the website's `bbnow` storefront
with entry context `10`; location cookies alone are not sufficient to select it.
Scrapfly, browser, and direct requests use the same storefront.

Stock alerts require all three availability fields: `avail_status: "001"`,
`button: "Add"`, and Boolean `not_for_sale: false`. Missing or contradictory
availability cannot trigger an alert. Only search-result products are considered,
not catalog variant/consolidated blocks. Invalid responses are logged as failed
scans, not interpreted as an empty out-of-stock listing. Logs include the
availability fields used for each handset's decision.

### View Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on any workflow run
3. Click on **"check-discount"** job
4. Expand the **"Check Flipkart discount"** step to see logs

Example log output:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow not running?

- Check if GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- GitHub Actions might have a delay of a few minutes

### Not receiving emails?

- Verify all three secrets are set correctly in GitHub
- Check your Gmail spam/junk folder
- Ensure 2-Step Verification and App Password are set up correctly
- Check workflow logs for error messages

### "Authentication failed" error?

- Make sure you're using an **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- Regenerate the App Password if needed

### Script not detecting discount?

- The website structure may have changed
- Check the logs to see what discount was detected
- You may need to update the scraping logic in `check_discount.py`
